File Transfer (Globus)
======================

Using Globus Online
-------------------

Copying files and folders in and out an HPC cluster is a routine task for HPC users. Users need to move input data to the cluster before this data can be processed. The results will be moved out of the cluster in form of files and folders containing text, figures, tables or some other data. The amount of data could be as small as a simple text file with a few lines or as big as large binary files and folders summing Giga Bytes of data. 

Globus Online is the preferred method for transferring files to, from, and between Research Computing Resources.  WVU is also a `Globus Subscriber <https://www.globus.org/subscriptions>`__ which provides additional services over the basic/free subscription.   Globus Online offers the following advantages over traditional transfer methods (i.e. scp, sftp, rsync):

#.  Auto performance tuning to ensure the data is transferred as quickly as possible.  One can expect a speedup of at least 2x over traditional transfer methods.
#.  Safe transfers by ensuring data integrity using checksum methods.
#.  Transfers are automatically restarted after a failed or stopped connection.
#.  Ability to only transfer files that have yet to be transferred (similar to rsync).
#.  Transfers are done in the background so users do not need to remain logged into the system.

WVU's Globus Subscription adds the following features:

#.  Ability to archive/transfer data with unlimited storage to user's `Google Drive MIX Account <https://wvu.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/article/299335692?src=-555450868>`__.
#.  Sharing of data with others inside and outside the university.
#.  Sharing of data from personal workstations via `Globus Connect Personal <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`__.
