Fortran, C and C++
==================

Scientific computing traces its roots to the very origin of computers. 
The first electro-mechanical computers originally were created to compute large numerical calculations much faster than humans can do. 
With the evolution of computers came new ways of expressing algorithms in ways closer to human languages but still very close to the internal operation of electronic machines. 
With the new electronic computers in the 1950's, programmers used  assembly language (or assembler language), low-level programming language with a close correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
Programming in assembly is very time consuming and prone to error. 
New programming languages evolved to facilitate the translation of algorithms into code, avoiding almost entirely the need for writing in assembler.
Today, three dominant low level languages for scientific computing are Fortran, C and C++.

Fortran is the oldest of those three, and many algorithms that are fundamental for most problems in science were written in it. 
Fortran 77 was for many years the standard de facto for scientific computing and have evolve over the years with Fortran 90, 95, 2003 and 2008.

C is a general purpose language and used in most of the basic software written in Unix environments. The language itself is not targeted to write scientific programs so it less expressive for vectors and matrices compared to Fortran.

C++ is the third language in the list. C++ is in many ways an extension of C with high element constructs such as classes. C++ is widely used in desktop applications, games and also scientific applications.

Fortran, C and C++ shared a number of attributes. These languages need a compiler that translates the source code into machine code. Parallelization interfaces such as MPI are written with explicit support for those three languages and compiler suites such as GCC, Intel and NVIDIA HPC include those languages by default.

Accessing C, C++ and Fortran Compilers
--------------------------------------

In an HPC cluster is customary to include compilers for Fortran, C and C++ by default. On Linux machines the usual compilers are from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). However, the versions of those compilers is old for the purpose of many scientific packages and do not support recent CPU extensions and parallelization extensions such as OpenMP or OpenACC. For example, on Thorny Flat the default versions of the compilers are 4.8, one way of identifying the version of gcc compilers is running the command::

  $> gfortran -v
  Using built-in specs.
  COLLECT_GCC=gfortran
  COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.8.5/lto-wrapper
  Target: x86_64-redhat-linux
  Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --with-bugurl=http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla --enable-bootstrap --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --enable-checking=release --with-system-zlib --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-libunwind-exceptions --enable-gnu-unique-object --enable-linker-build-id --with-linker-hash-style=gnu --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++,java,fortran,ada,go,lto --enable-plugin --enable-initfini-array --disable-libgcj --with-isl=/builddir/build/BUILD/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/isl-install --with-cloog=/builddir/build/BUILD/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/cloog-install --enable-gnu-indirect-function --with-tune=generic --with-arch_32=x86-64 --build=x86_64-redhat-linux
  Thread model: posix
  gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36) (GCC)

It is usually better to use environment modules to access newer versions of GCC or compilers from other vendors such as Intel or NVIDIA.
Each compilerfor the three languages and for each vendor has its own name.
