Fortran, C and C++
==================

Scientific computing traces its roots to the very origin of computers. Machines originally created to compute large numerical calculations much faster than humans can do. With the evolution of computers came new ways of expressing algorithms in ways closer to human languages but still very close to the internal operation of electronic machines. The three dominant languages for scientific computing are Fortran, C and C++.

Fortran is the oldest of those three, and many algorithms that are fundamental for most problems in science were written in it. Fortran 77 was for many years the standard de facto for scientific computing and have evolve over the years with Fortran 90, 95, 2003 and 2008.
