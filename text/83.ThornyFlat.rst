Thorny Flat (2019-)
===================

Thorny Flat is current WVU's general purpose HPC Cluster.  It was deployed in February 2019 and funded in large part by `NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Grant Award #1726534 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1726534&HistoricalAwards=false>`_. The cluster has a total of 6196 CPU cores spread over 170 nodes using a shared Intel Omnipath 100Gbps Interconnect. The system is a heterogeneous cluster in which there are different node types. In addition, each year a new addition is added to the cluster, which is known as a new phase. The cluster has five phases and currently is in phase 2.

Overview
--------

*(This text can be used for proposals to Grant Funding Agencies)*

Thorny Flat is a general-purpose High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.
Thorny Flat serves the HPC needs of West Virginia University (WVU) and other
higher education institutions in West Virginia. It is hosted in Pittsburgh
Supercomputer Center and was built thanks to NSF Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) Grant Award #1726534

Thorny Flat is a cluster of 178 compute nodes plus 4 management nodes.
The total number of CPU cores in compute nodes is 6516.

There are three main partition types - research team partitions, the standby partition, and community node partitions.

Research Team Partitions
------------------------

Research teams that have bought their own compute nodes have private partitions that link all their compute nodes together. Only users given permission from the research team's buyer (Usually the labs PI) will have permission to directly submit jobs to these partitions. While these are private partitions - unused resources/compute nodes from these partitions will be available to the standby partition (see below). However, per the system-wide policies, all research team's compute nodes must be available to the research team's users within 4 hours of job submission.  By default, these partitions are regulated by first come, first serve queuing. However, individual research teams can ask for different settings for their respective partition, and should `contact <Getting Help>`__ the RC HPC team with these requests.

Standby Partition
-----------------

The standy partition is for using resources from research teams partitions that are not currently being used. Priority on the standby partition is set by fair share queuing. This means that user priority is assigned based on a combination of the size of the job and how much system resources the user have used during the given week, with higher priority assigned to larger jobs and/or user jobs that have used fewer system resources in the week. Further, the standby partition has a 4-hour wall time.

Community Node Partitions
-------------------------

Thorny Flat has several partitions that start with the word 'comm'. These partitions are linked to the 73 compute/GPU nodes bought using NSF funding sources, and as such open for Statewide Higher Education use. 
These partitions are separated by node type (i.e. extra large memory, and GPU) and can be used by all users. Currently, these nodes are regulated by fair share queuing. This means that user priority is assigned based on a combination of the size of the job and how much system resources the user has used during the given week, with higher priority assigned to larger jobs and/or user jobs that have used less system resources in the week. Further, all community partitions have a week wall time, except for the (comm\_small\_day). comm\_small\_day allows jobs up 24 hours; and, this partition class has access to a larger number of resources than than comm\_small\_week). These restrictions are set to prevent a single user from occupying a large number of the community resources for an excessively long time.

Hardware acceleration
---------------------

Thorny Flat has 11 compute nodes with hardware accelerators in the form of NVIDIA GPU cards. 
The GPUs present on Thorny Flat are NVIDIA P6000, NVIDIA QUADRO RTX6000 and NVIDIA A100
The following table describes the distribution of accelerators in the GPU compute nodes.

Full specifications for the GPU cards can be found for `Quadro P6000`_ , `Quadro RTX 6000`_ and `NVIDIA A100`_ 

The GPUs in Thorny Flat have different compute capabilities.
The compute capability of a device is represented by a version number, also sometimes called its “SM version”. 
This version number identifies the features supported by the GPU hardware and is used by applications at runtime to determine which hardware features and/or instructions are available on the present GPU.

The compute capability comprises a major revision number X and a minor revision number Y and is denoted by X.Y.

Devices with the same major revision number are of the same core architecture. 
The major revision number is 8 for devices based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture (like A100), 7 for devices based on the Volta architecture (like the Quadro RTX 6000), and 6 for devices based on the Pascal architecture (like the Quadro P6000). 

You can see `Compute Capabilities`_ for other GPU cards.
