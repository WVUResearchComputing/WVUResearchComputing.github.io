Research Computing at West Virginia University
==============================================

.. image:: /_static/ResearchComputing.png

West Virginia University Research Computing (WVU-RC) is a team inside WVU's
Research Office dedicated to supporting, enabling and
advancing computational research at WVU.

This site contains information about how to use the various technologies
provided by the Research Computing division at West Virginia University.
Most documentation here refers to our High Performance Computing clusters
but we also provide a variety of other services a large storage service called
DataDepot, a DMZ (demilitarized zone) for high speed data transfers called
Research Exchange (REX) and support and training in areas of High Performance
Computing, Data Analysis and Parallel Programming.

The contents of this website can be downloaded as a single PDF here:
`docs_hpc_wvu.pdf <https://docs.hpc.wvu.edu/docs_hpc_wvu.pdf>`_

There are several websites associated with WVU-RC activities, here is a list of
the most relevant ones:

The official webpage in Research Office portal about the Research Computing Division
   `WVU Research Computing - Research Office <https://research.wvu.edu/researchers/computational-research/hpc>`_

The legacy documentation was a Wiki website that will continue to be online for a while
   `WVU Research Computing - Legacy Wiki <https://wiki.hpc.wvu.edu/hpc_wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_

The HelpDesk ticket system
   `WVU Research Computing - HPC HelpDesk <https://helpdesk.hpc.wvu.edu>`_

If your research was possible thanks to the use of our clusters please acknowledge the support using these comments:
For Spruce Knob:

    "Computational resources were provided by the WVU Research Computing Spruce Knob HPC cluster, which is funded in part by NSF EPS-1003907."

For Thorny Flat:

    "Computational resources were provided by the WVU Research Computing Thorny Flat HPC cluster, which is funded in part by NSF OAC-1726534."

For requesting help, create a new ticket at the Research Computing HPC Help
Desk web page. You are welcome to e-mail any member of the WVU-RC team directly,
but since we are not always at our desk, the ticket system will guarantee that
your support question will be seen by someone currently available.
