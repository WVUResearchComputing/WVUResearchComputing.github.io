MATLAB
======

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks.
MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.

There are several ways of working with Matlab.
As a desktop application you can work interactively using Matlab's graphical user interface (GUI). There you can type commmands and see those executed in real time.
You can also load scripts and produce plots. 
The GUI offers a variety of benefits, autocompletion, plot displaying and documentation.

An alternative to the GUI is a terminal-based interactive interface. 
You can execute the same commands but you work on a terminal.
Depending if the terminal can create windows or not, you coul be forced to export plots as images instead of visualizing those directly on your screen.

Finally, ther is the option of executing Matlab scripts (.m files) calling Matlab as the interpreter of the code.
This option is the closest to the original spirit of working on an HPC cluster. 
The work is prepared to be executed without human intervention once the job executes.

In the following sections we will cover how to request jobs under these three modes.

At the end we will present a small introduction to strategies to improve performance of Matlab jobs.
One way is via Compiling the code, another is adding some parallelization to take advantage of multicore compute nodes.

Interactive execution using Open On-Demand
------------------------------------------

An HPC cluster is conglomerate of computers inteded to be operated as a single machine.
This is different from the way you work on a normal desktop computer, we you are completely in control of the applications launched, many of them with graphical interfaces.
The HPC cluster offers a web interface called Open On-Demand where you can launch an interactive job that creates a virtual desktop, allowing you to work on the cluster as close as possible as working on a desktop machine. 
The virtual desktop will be running on a compute node with all the computational power associated with it.
The only downside could be the responsiveness to commands depending on how fast is the network between your computer and the the HPC cluster.

To Access Open On-Demand, direct your web browser to https://ondemand-tf.hpc.wvu.edu 
Open On-Demand support modern web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, macOS Safari and Microsoft Edge.
Once you connect to https://ondemand-tf.hpc.wvu.edu you will be directed to WVU Single Sign-On (SSO).
You will have to enter your username and password and authorize your access with DUO.
Once you succeed in the authorization you will land on the Open On-Demand dashboard shown below.

Click on "Interactive Apps" and select "Thorny Desktop"
A formulary will ask you to selected the "partition," "walltime" and number of "CPU cores" to use during your interactive session.
The screenshots below show some good values for a normal execution of Matlab on the cluster.

  :alt: Using Matlab with Open On-Demand (figure 2)


Here we are using "standby" as SLURM partition, 1 hour of walltime and 1 CPU core. 
There is not much advantage on requesting more than 2 CPU cores if your Matlab code is not using some sort of parallel programming.
Go to the bottom and click "Launch"

  :alt: Using Matlab with Open On-Demand (figure 3)


The browser tab will change to show you the current list of "Interactive Sessions" running in Open On-Demand.
On the top of the list is your newely created "Thorny Desktop" session. 
It will be waiting from a few seconds to some munutes until a compute node is assigned to the job and the Virtual Desktop is created there.
Once the virtual desktop is created a button "Launch Thorny Desktop" appears and clicking there will open a new browser tab with a view on a Linux desktop.
The Linux desktop selected is very clean to prevent wasting resources.
The screenshot below shows how the desktop looks like.
Click on the Terminal button and load the module for Matlab

  :alt: Using Matlab with Open On-Demand (figure 5)

Once the module is loaded execute the command `matlab` on the terminal.
With GUI of matlab will open after a few seconds.
A screen will will show the version being loaded 

.. image:: /_static/Matlab-OOD-6.jpg

Now you can start executing matlab commands in the "Command Window".
You can also load .m files and create plots as shown below.

Interactive execution on the terminal
-------------------------------------
Loading Matlab using Environment Modules
----------------------------------------

MATLAB is accessible via environment Modules on Thorny Flat.
To check which versions are available execute::

    trcis001:~$ module avail matlab

    -------------------- /shared/modulefiles/tier1 --------------------
    matlab/2021a matlab/2022b

Load the desired version with::

    trcis001:~$ module avail matlab/2021a

or simply load the latest version executing::

    trcis001:~$ module load matlab

Notice that the commands above load matlab on the login node.
You must never use the login node for any execution that last for more than a few seconds.
Computationally demanding calculations must be executed via job submissions.


From the login node, request a interactive session with SLURM::

    trcis001:~$ module load sched/slurm/22.05
    trcis001:~$ srun -n 4 --pty bash
    srun: job 24328 queued and waiting for resources
    srun: job 24328 has been allocated resources
    tarcl100:~$

Non-interactive execution via job submission
--------------------------------------------

This simple tutorial explains how to use Matlab without launching the
graphical interface and using the submission script.


Consider this simple script that computes first and second derivatives
of a function to find extrema and inflection points of a given function.

To download the code you can execute the following command directly on the cluster::

    trcis001:~$ wget https://docs.hpc.wvu.edu/_static/derivatives.zip

Or download the file :download:`derivatives.zip <../_static/derivatives.zip>`.
And upload the file to the cluster.

You can create a directory for this, for example `MATLAB_TUT1` and uncompress
there the file `derivatives.zip`::

    trcis001:~$ mkdir MATLAB_TUT1
    trcis001:~$ cd MATLAB_TUT1
    trcis001:~$ wget https://docs.hpc.wvu.edu/_static/derivatives.zip
    trcis001:~$ unzip derivatives.zip

It will uncompress a file called `derivatives.m`.
The file contains the matlab code that we would like to execute on the cluster.

Write a submission script for SLURM. 
For this example we will use a single core on a single machine (on Thorny Flat)::
Use your prefered text editor and type the following lines::

    #!/bin/bash
    
    #SBATCH --job-name=MATLAB
    #SBATCH --output=SLURM-%x.%j.out
    #SBATCH --partition=standby
    
    #SBATCH --time=10:00
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=5000

    module purge
    module load matlab

    cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
    matlab -nodisplay -r derivatives

Store this lines into a file called `runjob.slurm`

This submission script is telling the SLURM workload manager that we are creating a
job called "MATLAB", that will use one node (`--ntasks=1`) and one core per
node (`--cpus-per-task=2`), during 10 minutes (`--time=10:00`). 
The partition were the job is submitted is called `standby` but you can also choose other
partitions such as `comm\_mmem\_week` or `comm\_mmem\_day`. that will offer
extended periods of time.

The lines module purge and module load statistics/matlab/2014a will
prepare the environment for executing Matlab on the HPC cluster.

Finally, the script will execute the matlab script "derivatives.m"
without opening the graphical user interface (GUI). Notive that you
should execute matlab -nodisplay -r derivatives without adding the ".m".
Matlab will always search for a file called "derivatives.m"

You submit the job from the command line executing::

    trcis001:~$ module load sched/slurm/22.05 
    trcis001:~$ sbatch runjob.slurm 
    Submitted batch job 26212

When the job is submitted you get a number called Job ID.
This number is an identifier that allow you to keep track of lifetime of the job. 
You can monitor the execution using the command squeue::

    trcis001:~$ squeue -j 26212
                JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
                26212   standby   MATLAB gufranco  R       0:10      1 tbmcs101

You notice the job is running when the state (ST) shows as `R` and you see under `TIME` for how long the job has been running.

When finished, `squeue` will return an error as the job no longer exist in queue::

    trcis001:~$ squeue -j 26212
    slurm_load_jobs error: Invalid job id specified

You can see the job with `sacct` a command for accounting, ie keeping track of the jobs running and complete.
When the job is still runnning you get::

    trcis001:~$ sacct -j 26212
    JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
    ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
    26212            MATLAB    standby its-rc-ad+          2    RUNNING      0:0 
    26212.batch       batch            its-rc-ad+          2    RUNNING      0:0 


Once the job finishes, either by a normal termination or because it was canceled::

    trcis001:~$ sacct -j 26212
    JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
    ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
    26212            MATLAB    standby its-rc-ad+          2  COMPLETED      0:0 
    26212.batch       batch            its-rc-ad+          2  COMPLETED      0:0 

When the job concludes, you will get new files that were created by the job::

    trcis001:~$ ls -1
    derivatives.fig
    derivatives.m
    derivatives.png
    derivatives.zip
    runjob.slurm
    SLURM-MATLAB.26206.out

The figures where generated and saved on the same folder you submit your
job. The output of your execution is stored on `SLURM-MATLAB.26206.out`

Using the Matlab Compiler
-------------------------

The first step is to load matlab to get access to its executables::

    trcis001:~$ module load matlab

Prepare the compilation environment with::

    trcis001:~$ mbuild -setup``
       MBUILD configured to use 'gcc' for C language compilation.``

       To choose a different language, execute one from the following:``
        mex -setup C++ -client MBUILD ``
        mex -setup FORTRAN -client MBUILD``

You cannot compile matlab scripts that uses the symbolic toolbox

https://www.mathworks.com/products/ineligible_programs.html

So we will use another script for this tutorial.

`mandelbrot.zip <Media:mandelbrot.zip>`__

Download the file :download:`mandelbrot.zip <../_static/mandelbrot.zip>`.

After uncompress the file "mandelbrot.m"::

    trcis001:~$ mcc -m mandelbrot.m

It takes a while, when finished you will get some extra files::

    trcis001:~$ ls -1
    mandelbrot
    run_mandelbrot.sh

Write a submission script for SLURM (Spruce Flat)::

    #!/bin/bash
    
    #SBATCH --job-name=MATLAB
    #SBATCH --output=SLURM-%x.%j.out
    #SBATCH --partition=standby
    
    #SBATCH --time=10:00
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=5000

    module purge
    module load matlab

    cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
    ./run_mandelbrot.sh /shared/software/MATLAB/R2022b

After submit the job with::

    trcis001:~$ module load sched/slurm/22.05 
    trcis001:~$ sbatch runjob.slurm
    Submitted batch job 26213

You get the results on "MATLAB.o#######" with the corresponding JobID
