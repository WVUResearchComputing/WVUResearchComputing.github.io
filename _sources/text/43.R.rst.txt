Installing R Packages in default Directories
--------------------------------------------

The two usual ways to install R packages from CRAN is either executing

::

    install.packages('<Package Name>')

from the R prompt. Or using the command

::

    R CMD INSTALL <package>

from the command line. The second command only works if you have already
downloaded a copy of the package from CRAN or an external site. The
first will automatically download the package from CRAN. R will
automatically detect that you do not have permissions to write in the
system-wide R library folder and will prompt if you would like to
install in a local directory from within your home directory. This
folder will also be checked automatically when you run R for packages,
allowing you to use anything you install in this way.

Installing R Packages in non-default directories
------------------------------------------------

Using install.packages()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use install.packages from the R prompt, before you start R you need
to modify the R\_LIBS environment variable

::

    export R_LIBS=<dir>

Then inside the R prompt you execute install.packages() as normal (see
above).

Using R CMD INSTALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For 'R CMD INSTALL' command, you can specify the path with the l flag
(lowercase 'L')

::

    R CMD INSTALL -l <dir> <package_name>

Using Installed Packages from non-default directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use locally installed packages, before you execute R you just need to
modify the R\_LIBS environment variable to tell R where to search for
local packages.

::

    export R_LIBS=<dir>
