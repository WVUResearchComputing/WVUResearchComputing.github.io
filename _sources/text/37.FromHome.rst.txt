Effective Research Computing from Home
======================================

Doing research from Home has its own challenges.
This document will guide you about several strategies that can make help you
moving your calculations on the cluster more effective, managing the post processing eficient under restrictive network conditions and in general help you moving your research forward with the minimal disruption posible.

We are considering a research workflow that includes the following steps.

  1. Gather some data that will be used as input for calculations, models, analysis, etc. The data needs to be processed on a HPC cluster as it demands computational resources that exceeds those from a normal laptop or desktop computer.

  2. The processing of the data will involved either submitting jobs to the cluster or running interactive executions. Sometimes a few jobs will be enough but often the jobs multiply, several cases must be considered and you end up
