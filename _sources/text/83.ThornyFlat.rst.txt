There are three main queue types - research team queues, the standby
queue, and community node queues.

Research Team Queues
--------------------

Research teams that have bought their own compute nodes have private queues that link all their compute nodes together. Only users given permission from the research team's buyer (Usually the labs PI) will have permission to directly submit jobs to these queues. While these are private queues - unused resources/compute nodes from these queues will be available to the standby queue (see below). However, per the system-wide policies, all research team's compute nodes must be available to the research team's users within 4 hours of job submission.  By default, these queues are regulated by first come, first serve queuing. However, individual research teams can ask for different settings for their respective queue, and should `contact <Getting Help>`__ the RC HPC team with these requests. 
 
Standby Queue
-------------

The standy queue is for using resources from research teams queues that are not currently being used. Priority on the standby queue is set by fair share queuing. This means that user priority is assigned based on a combination of the size of the job and how much system resources the user have used during the given week, with higher priority assigned to larger jobs and/or user jobs that have used fewer system resources in the week. Further, the standby queue has a 4 hour wall time.
  
Community Node Queues
---------------------

Thorny Flat has several queues that start with the word 'comm'. These queues are linked to the 73 compute/GPU nodes bought using NSF funding sources, and as such is open for Statewide Higher Education use, hardware/resource information can be found on the `Thorny Flat Systems page <Systems_Spruce>`__ These queues are separated by node type (i.e.  extra large memory, and gpu) and can be used by all users. Currently, these nodes are regulated by fair share queuing. This means that user priority is assigned based on a combination of the size of the job and how much system resources the user have used during the given week, with higher priority assigned to larger jobs and/or user jobs that have used less system resources in the week. Further, all community queues have a week wall time, except for the (comm\_small\_day). comm\_small\_day allows jobs up 24 hours; and, this queue class has access to a larger number of resources than than comm\_small\_week). These restrictions are set to prevent a single user occupying a large number of the community resources for an excessively long time.
