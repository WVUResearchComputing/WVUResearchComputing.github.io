Engineering: OpenFOAM 10
========================


On Thorny Flat OpenFOAM 10 is available via Singularity containers.
There are two images on these locations::

    /shared/containers/openfoam10-graphical-apps.sif
    /shared/containers/openfoam10-paraview56.sif
   

Run OpenFOAM with an interactive job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start by creating an interactive job, for the simple examples such as the tutorials, requesting 4 cores is more than enough::

    $> qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=4

After a few minutes you get a message indicating that a compute node and corresponding cores have been assigned, you get connected to the compute node::

    qsub: waiting for job 1660023.trcis002.hpc.wvu.edu to start
    qsub: job 1660023.trcis002.hpc.wvu.edu ready

    18:28:50-username@tcgcx300:~$

Lets work on the `$SCRATCH` folder and create a subfolder there::

    $> cd $SCRATCH
    $> mkdir openfoam_tutorial
    $> cd openfoam_tutorial

Load the module for singularity and get a shell inside the container::

    $> module load singularity
    $> singularity shell /shared/containers/openfoam10-paraview56.sif

Lets copy one of the examples in the tutorials::

    Singularity> cp -r /opt/openfoam10/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity .      
    Singularity> cd cavity/
    Singularity> ls
    Allclean  Allrun  cavity  cavityClipped  cavityGrade

The tutorials include some scripts with easier access to the utilities in OpenFOAM::

    Singularity> . $WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions

The mesh is prepared with the command::

    Singularity> runApplication blockMesh
    Running blockMesh on /scratch/gufranco/openfoam_tutorial/cavity/cavity

And running the particular application from OpenFOAM::

    Singularity> runApplication icoFoam    
    Running icoFoam on /scratch/gufranco/openfoam_tutorial/cavity/cavity 

This is a very simple example that takes less than a second to run.
The result of the mesh preparation and simulation is a set of files in the current folder and log files::

    Singularity> ls
    0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  constant  log.blockMesh  log.icoFoam  system

For example the ouput of the log for icoFoam is posted there (first and last lines)::
