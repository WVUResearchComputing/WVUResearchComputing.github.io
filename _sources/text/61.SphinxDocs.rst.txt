Documentation on Sphinx
=======================

Creation
--------

1. Create a Repostory called

WVUResearchComputing.github.io


2.

Changing the documents
----------------------

These are the steps to create a working environment for introducing changes to the documentation.
Create one folder for both "sphinx" and "master" branches::

    mkdir DOCS
    cd DOCS
    REPO="https://github.com/WVUResearchComputing/WVUResearchComputing.github.io.git"
    ORIGIN="git@github.com:WVUResearchComputing/WVUResearchComputing.github.io.git"
    git clone --single-branch -b sphinx ${REPO} sphinx
    git clone --single-branch -b master ${REPO} master
    cd sphinx
    git remote set-url origin ${ORIGIN}
    cd ../master
    git remote set-url origin ${ORIGIN}
    cd ..

After this commands, the DOCS folder will contain two subfolders, "sphinx" and "master".
The branch "sphinx" has the sources and "master" the generated web pages.

Editing the documentation is basically adding or modifying the ".rst" files in the subfolder "texts".
To compile the documentation enter into the "sphinx" folder and execute::

    make html
    make latexpdf
